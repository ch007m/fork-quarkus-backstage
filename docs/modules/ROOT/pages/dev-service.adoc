== Dev Service

The extension provides a Dev Service for Backstage that can be used to quickly test the integration with Backstage.
The Dev Service uses a custom minimal Backstage container that is configured to optionally, configure things like:

- Github integration
- https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea] integration

The Dev Service can be enabled using the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.backstage.devservices.enabled=true
----

When the Dev Service is started, the Backstage URL is reported in the console: 

[source]
----
2024-11-01 23:48:30,471 INFO  [io.qua.bac.dep.dev.BackstageDevServiceProcessor] (build-3) Backstage HTTP URL: http://localhost:35612
----

The URL above, can be used to access the Backstage UI.
Alternatively, the Backstage UI can be accessed from the `Backstage` card in the Dev UI: `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui`

The animation below shows how you can enable and access the Dev Service:

If you need to access https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea] the URL is reported in the console:

[source]
----
2024-11-05 09:04:58,723 INFO  [io.qua.jgi.dep.JGitDevServicesProcessor] (build-47) Gitea HTTP URL: http://localhost:32769
----

The default credentials for the https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea] Dev Service are: `quarkus` / `quarkus`.
https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea] can be accessed from the `Gitea` card in the Dev UI: `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui`

The animation below demonstrates the integration with https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea]:

=== Container image

The default container image used by the Dev Service is `quay.io/iocanel/backstage:0.1.0` and can be changed using the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.backstage.devservices.image=<custom image>
----

The source code of the image can be found at https://github.com/iocanel/backstage-docker[github.com/iocanel/backstage-docker].

#### Custom image requirements

To use a custom image, the following environment variables need to be supported: 

- **BACKSTAGE_TOKEN**: The token used by the Backstage back end for service to service communication
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: The token used by the Backstage back end to interact with Github
- **GITEA_HOST**: The host of the Gitea instance
- **GITEA_BASE_URL**: The base URL of the Gitea instance
- **GITEA_USERNAME**: The username used to authenticate with Gitea
- **GITEA_PASSWORD**: The password used to authenticate with Gitea

When these environment variables are set, the Dev Service needs to apply them to `app-config.production.yaml` before starting Backstage.

Additionally, the Backstage instance needs to have the following plugins installed and configured:

- @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-github'
- @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-gitea'

Finally, it is expected that the port 7007 is used.

=== Backstage Dev Service catalog

By default the catalog contains the following entities:

- A `Component` matching the current project
- Optional `API` entries for the detected APIs
- A `Location` pointing to the `Component`.

A `Location` is a special kind of entity that is used to reference other entities like `Component`, `API`, etc.
The `Location` is the only entity that can be directly installed in Backstage. All others need to be referenced as a URL by a `Location`.

This means that the entities above needs to be accessed as a URL by a `Location` entity. This is usually done by pushing them to a git repository and referencing the URL.

To avoid pushing the entities to a remote repository, the Dev Service uses another container running https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea] (provided by the https://quarkus.io/extensions/io.quarkiverse.jgit/quarkus-jgit/[Quarkus JGit extension]).

=== Dev Template

A special version of the template, the `Dev Template` is optionally generated and installed when using the Dev Service.

The Dev Template is a variation of the generated template that is modified so that it's usable a dev time and is integrated with the Dev Service.
More specifically the `Dev Template` is configured so that it publishes to https://about.gitea.com/[Gitea] instead of the actual remote repository.
This allows the developer to test the integration with Backstage without having to push the generated code to a remote repository.

==== Generating the Dev Template

To enable the generation of the `Dev Template` set the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.backstage.dev-template.generation.enabled=true
----

=== Automatic installation of the Dev Template

When the `Dev Template` is generated, it can be automatically installed in the Dev Service using the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.backstage.devservices.dev-template.installation.enabled=true
----
